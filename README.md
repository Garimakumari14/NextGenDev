Next-Gen Development Internship Overview
Welcome to the Next-Gen Development Internship! This program is designed to provide aspiring developers with hands-on experience in real-world projects, focusing on data science and machine learning applications. Throughout this internship, interns will gain practical skills by working on three fundamental projects: Titanic Survival Prediction, Sales Prediction, and Iris Flower Classification.

Project Descriptions
1. Titanic Survival Prediction:-
The Titanic Survival Prediction project involves analyzing historical data of Titanic passengers and predicting which passengers survived the disaster. Interns will delve into data preprocessing, feature engineering, and applying various machine learning algorithms (such as logistic regression, decision trees, or random forests) to create a model that predicts survival probabilities based on passenger characteristics.

2. Sales Prediction:-
The Sales Prediction project revolves around predicting future sales based on historical sales data. Interns will explore time series analysis techniques, feature extraction from temporal data, and utilize algorithms like ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) or LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks to forecast sales trends. The project emphasizes understanding business implications through accurate forecasting.

3. Iris Flower Classification:-
The Iris Flower Classification project involves building a machine learning model that can classify iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal dimensions. Interns will gain insights into data visualization techniques, model training using algorithms like K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, or neural networks, and evaluating model performance through metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

Goals and Learning Objectives
Hands-on Experience: Interns will gain practical experience in data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation.

Problem Solving: Learn how to approach and solve real-world problems in data science and machine learning domains.

Collaboration: Work collaboratively within teams, leveraging version control tools like GitHub for project management and code sharing.
